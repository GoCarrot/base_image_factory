# Base Image Factory

This provisions a Base Image from a previously created Root Image.

#### A note on terminology

We use `Root Image` to mean a completely unprovisioned bare image with nothing beyond a basic OS install. We use `Base Image` to mean a partially provisioned image with services required by all operational servers, e.g. monitoring, log aggregation, telemetry, etc.

## Local System Requirements
